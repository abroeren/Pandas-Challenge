UCSD data science bootcamp homework assignment no. 4

The purpose of this review is to anaylyze city school district data to help the  school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

An analysis has been requested of the district-wide standardized test results which include every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The purpose is to aggreate the data and determine obvious trends in school performance. 

The data is showing the following trends:

1. Average scores by school for all grades are consistent and mostly around 83 points, but average math scores  show an average of 77 points for 7 out of 15 schools.
2. The math plus reading passing percentage at smaller schools (less then 1,000 students) is 65% higher than at larger schools (2,000-5,000 students).
3. Charter schools score significantly higher than district schools in every category reviewed (90%-range versus 53%-range).
